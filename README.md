# Visitors-Contact-Form

A widget that will be used by visitors to contact MGA Entertainement on websites for each brand that the company has.

On the initial state of the widget:
1.	Add some form field validation:
a.	All fields are required. When the user clicks the Submit button and they have not filled out the required fields, the widget should look like Figure 3 with the appropriate error messages displayed to the user.
b.	When the user clicks the Submit button with the wrong phone number format, the widget should display the appropriate error message 
2.	Add a dynamic field as seen in Figure 5 when the user selects California on the State dropdown field. 
When the user clicks on the Start Chat button, and all fields are valid, replace the contents of the page with “Thank you!! We have received your message and will reach out to you as soon as humanly possible”..
